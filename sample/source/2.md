# Organizing your posts
As I said before, a blog typically doesn't exist of a single post. (Correct that: the majority of blogs _do_ actually exist of a single post, in which the author announces that he started his blog, and that it's all going to be a marvelous adventure, after which his blog goes numb. However, you are obviously not one of them.)

Adding another page to a Monkeyman site is not that hard. In fact, the page you are reading here was added just by adding a `2.md` file to the `source` folder. That's it. Monkeyman _will_ generate a proper HTML page from that as well, provided you added the layout as I mentioned in the previous post. 

However, even a bunch of HTML pages doesn't make a blog yet. You need to have a way to keep things organized. For instance, it's not uncommon to have an `index.html` page that contains your latest posts. And it's also not uncommon to have the ability to point back and forth between different posts.

## Have a landing page

When I said a minute ago that we wanted to have an index.html page, I really meant that we want to have a default landing page from which we can link to our posts. For static sites, this typically is the index.html page, since many hosting providers will redirect a naked path type of URL to the `index.html` page in that directory.

So, we need an index.html page as well. Now, by default, Monkeyman has a pretty straightforward to transform file system resources into output resources, and by default, it's always _one-to-one_. For a given Markdown file, it will turn it into just a single HTML file. 

Monkeyman _could_ have had something plugged in that renames the most recent (more on that in a minute) file to `index.html`, but that would not be ideal from an SEO and permalink perspective. You _really_ want to have your post to have a nicely formatted URL, and it needs to keep that name forever. Changing it from index.html to something else will break links and also confuse web crawlers.

Therefore, what you do need is the ability to _include_ HTML fragments into other pages. That is _exactly_ what Monkeyman allows you to do as well: all Resources have a method called `asHtmlFragment: Option[String]`. You can use that method to extract the raw HTML before the layout was applied. 

Having the ability to _include_ portions of other pages into other pages is _the first_ thing we need. But we also need something else. We need to be able to _reach out_ to those resources whose HTML fragments we want to include. How do we do that?

The answer is easy. For every template page (layout pages or other template pages) Monkeyman includes an `allResources` variable, which is a `Seq[Resource]`. Including _all_ resources in your page clearly doesn't make a lot of sense, but once you have _all resources_, you can filter out the ones you want to use by using Scala's usual collection operations, such as `filter(...)`.

Now we have all of the different bits and pieces to create a landing page, let's create one. Open `index.scaml` in the source directory, and add this:

    %html
      %head
        %title Monkeyman Blog
        %link(href={uri("css/default.css")} rel="stylesheet" type="text/css")
      %body
        - for (resource <- allResources.filter(res => res.tags.contains("blog")).take(3))
          .post
            %h1.title
              %a(href={resource.path})= resource.title
            .body
              - unescape(resource.asHtmlFragment)
            .tags
              - for (tag <- resource.tags - "blog")
                %span.tag= tag
    
The file itself is only _a little_ different than the `layout.scaml` file we created before. This time we added it to the `source` directory. Why? Well, because this is not just a layout we want to be applied to other pages. This is a page that we actually want to have generated as a resource _itself_.

In this particular case, the template grabs the list of all resources found by Monkeyman, and then filters out the ones that have been marked with the `blog` tag. From that list, it picks the first three. 

With that list of three resources marked `blog`, it now traverses all three of them, and inserts the post inside the `index.html` page. The `resource.asHtmlFragment` gets the content of that page as an HTML snippet. To top it of, it changes the title slightly and includes a hyperlink to the _actual_ permanent representation of that post.

As you can see, creating a page that includes fragments or metadata from other pages isn't all that hard. In this particular case, we used the `blog` tag to filter out the ones we need. That's not required. You could also have used a certain naming convention, like store all your blog posts in a certain director and filter on that. Monkeyman doesn't enforce a particular way of working; you can combine content in any way you like.

Now, this is all very nice, but perhaps it listed the pages you expected to see in the wrong order. That is annoying. But we can easily solve that using the mechanisms that we have just learned about.

## Sorting by publication date

First a word on publication dates itself. _Every_ resource has a publication date and time. By default it just picks the last modification date of the file from which it was created. If that seems weird to you, then you will happy to know that this is something you can actually override.  This is - again - one of the areas in which Monkeyman will grow, but for now you can override it using YAML frontmatter, just like the resource's title.

    ---
    pubDateTime: 1992-23-01
    ---

Adding the above to the top of your Markdown file will force the pubDateTime to be set to January 23, 1992. 

Including the publication date in your page is easy, but if you want to format it in your own way, then you (currently) have to create a DateTimeFormatter for it. 

    - val dateFormat = org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormat.forPattern("EEEE d MMMM, hh:mm")
    ...
    %h1.title
      %a(href={resource.path})= resource.title
    .pubDate= dateFormat.print(resource.pubDateTime)
    .body
    ...

But just adding the publication date to a post doesn't sort it yet. In order to get it sorted, you need to change the way we loop over the results of our `allSources` query:

    - val matching = allResources
    -   .filter(_.tags.contains("blog"))
    -   .sortBy(_.pubDateTime)
    -   .reverse
    -   .take(3)
    - for (resource <- matching)

In order to make it a little easier on the eyes, I split it up into several lines: first, I'm getting all resources with a "blog" tag. Then I'm sorting those resources by their publication date time. (Note that even though LocalDateTime itself is not _comparable_, you don't have to bother passing your own `Ordering[LocalDateTime]`. That value is implicitly included. That's for Scala experts. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then you should just ignore and it, and read: "there is nothing else I need to do".)

Now we have the list sorted by date. Only, it's in the wrong order. We need reverse order. There are better ways for achieving it, but let's for now simply reverse the entire list. Once that is done, I'm grabbing the first three items. That's it. The entire `index.html` now looks like this:

    - val dateFormat = org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormat.forPattern("EEEE d MMMM, hh:mm")
    %html
      %head
        %title
        %link(href={uri("css/default.css")} rel="stylesheet" type="text/css")
      %body
        - val matching = allResources
        -   .filter(_.tags.contains("blog"))
        -   .sortBy(_.pubDateTime)
        -   .reverse
        -   .take(3)
        - for (resource <- matching)
          .post
            %h1.title
              %a(href={resource.path})= resource.title
            .pubDate= dateFormat.print(resource.pubDateTime)
            .body
              - unescape(resource.asHtmlFragment)
            .tags
              - for (tag <- resource.tags - "blog")
                %span.tag= tag
